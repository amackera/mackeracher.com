We live in strange times. The processor in your computer can execute
20 instructions in the time in takes the light from your screen to
reach your eyes; and yet sometimes it feels like we can never get
enough speed or space. The more capable the computer, the more complex
the software.

Today's developer software is heavy. IDEs, terminal emulators,
linting, language servers, and git integrations are baseline features,
costing significant overhead when doing something even as simple as
editing text files.

At the same time, as software developers, the software we use to do
our job matters a lot to our productivity. If I need an extra GB of
RAM to write better code, I'll get it. There's a reason beefy
computers are called "work stations".
