Hello, world ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the newly refreshed
[mackeracher.com](https://mackeracher.com). This is my personal
website.

## What's up here

I'm hoping to use this space to collect my thoughts on computer
programming, entrepreneurship, and whatever else strikes me. I like
reading and writing, and I felt that it might be nice to publish some
of what I write, maybe some of you out there will find some of this
useful!

## Themes, ideas, plans

No promises to update this website regularly. When I do publish any
posts, they'll likely be about using Emacs, programming with Clojure,
functional programming, entrepreneurship, financial technology, or
Canada.
