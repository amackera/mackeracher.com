I'm fascinated by software that's stood the test of time. Developers
who write venerable software have spent their time on an incredibly
high leverage persuit.

Aged and battle tested software projects that don't bend to the latest
fad are always worth understanding. New ideas are often actually
reified old ideas, and keen developers who get that have a leg up.

One of the most notable (and venerable) of all software packages in
history is the great text editor `emacs`. Emacs is more than a
software package, it's a philosophy and a way of life. Approaching
Emacs for the fist time can be very intimidating. The learning curve
isn't as steep as vim, where one must learn a new way to speak to the
computer, but it's more meandering. Progress is not a straight line.
