## Welcome, friend. Stay a while...

You've found yourself at the personal webpage of Anson MacKeracher,
errant software developer and occasional entrepreneur mostly based out
of Toronto, Canada.

Here you can find a collection of my recent writings, links to my
recent projects, and ways to contact me. Please don't be shy!

I'm not looking for any employment opportunities or consulting
engagements at this time, so if that's what you're after you can save
yourself a bit of time by not contacting me. Thanks!
