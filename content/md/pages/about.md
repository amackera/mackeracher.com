## Welcome, friend. Stay a while...

Hello, friend! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anson, errant software engineer, and CTO/co-founder of
[LegalMate](https://legalmate.co). We're improving access to justice
by offering affordable financing for legal matters.

Prior to LegalMate, I founded the startup lab
[Deeptree](https://deeptree.com) (creators of
[CadenceBot](https://cadencebot.com) and I ran Engineering at
[Ada](https://ada.cx) and [Top Hat](https://tophat.com).

These days, my chosen tools are
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/)([Script](https://clojurescript.org/)),
[re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame), and
[polylith](https://github.com/polyfy/polylith).

Here you can find a collection of my recent writings, links to my
recent projects, and ways to contact me. Please don't be shy!

I'm not looking for any employment opportunities or consulting
engagements at this time, thanks!
