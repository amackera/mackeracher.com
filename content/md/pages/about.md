## Welcome, friend. Stay a while...

Hello, friend! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anson: knight errant, software engineer, and CTO/co-founder of
[LegalMate](https://legalmate.co). We're improving access to justice
by offering affordable financing for legal matters.

Prior to LegalMate, I founded the startup lab
[Deeptree](https://deeptree.com) (creators of
[CadenceBot](https://cadencebot.com) and I ran Engineering at
[Ada](https://ada.cx) and [Top Hat](https://tophat.com).

These days, my chosen tools are
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/)([Script](https://clojurescript.org/)),
[re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame), and
[polylith](https://github.com/polyfy/polylith).

Here you can find a collection of any of my recent writings and links
to my recent projects. You can contact me at anson [at]
mackeracher.com.

I'm not looking for any employment opportunities or consulting
engagements at this time, thanks!
