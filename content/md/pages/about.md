## About Me

I'm Anson MacKeracher: swashbucker, software engineer, and CTO at
[LegalMate](https://legalmate.co). We're improving access to justice
by offering embedded financial tools for the legal industry. Prior to
LegalMate I ran Engineering at [Ada](https://ada.cx), and before that
I ran Engineering at [Top Hat](https://tophat.com). In a past life,
together with some [good](https://www.straightlinephobia.com/) &nbsp;
[friends](https://www.willbenmitch.com/), I created
[CadenceBot](https://cadencebot.com). Over the last 20 years of
programming, I've shipped software that's been downloaded billions of
times and touched the lives of tens of millions of people across the
world.

These days, my chosen tools are
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/),
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/)([Script](https://clojurescript.org/)),
[re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame), and
[polylith](https://github.com/polyfy/polylith). I prefer simple,
understandable, tools that enhance my productivity, and so over the
past few years I've been drawn inexorably toward the Clojure
community.

I'm **not** looking for any employment or consulting opportunities at
this time, thanks!
